# 📦 Day 4: Arrays & Objects – Inventory Tracker

Welcome to **Day 4** of my full-stack journey!  
Today's focus was on learning how to organize, access, and manipulate data using **arrays** and **objects**—the backbone of real-world applications.

---

## 📚 What I Learned Today

### ✅ Arrays
- Creating arrays
- Accessing elements with indexes
- Looping through arrays using `for`, `forEach`, `map`
- Adding/removing elements: `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`

### ✅ Objects
- Creating key-value pairs
- Accessing and updating properties with dot/bracket notation
- Nesting objects and arrays
- Using `for...in` and `Object.keys()`

### ✅ Practical Combo Use
- Storing objects inside arrays (like a list of products)
- CRUD-like operations on array data
- Data-driven rendering in the console

## 🛠 Mini Project: Inventory Tracker (CLI App)

### 📌 Project Description

Built a basic inventory tracker that:
- Stores a list of products in an array of objects
- Allows adding new items
- Lets the user view all items
- (Optional) Search or filter items by name/category

> This is a baby step toward building **e-commerce**, **CRUD dashboards**, and **admin panels**.
