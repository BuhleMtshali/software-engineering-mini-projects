# 📅 Day 2 — JavaScript Variables & Prompt Game 🎮

## 💡 What I Did
Today I dived headfirst into the world of JavaScript variables, strings, and user interaction! I created a fun little **CLI quiz game** that tests your knowledge about South Africa's iconic cities 🇿🇦. Specifically: *Do you know what the Mother City is?* 😏

## 🛠️ Tech + Tools
- Node.js
- JavaScript ES6
- `prompt-sync` (for taking user input in the terminal like a boss)

## 🎯 The Mission
Create a mini quiz that:
- Prompts the user to answer the question: `"What is the Mother City?"`
- Checks if their answer matches the correct city (`"Cape Town"`), regardless of how they capitalize it
- Gives positive feedback for the correct answer ✅
- Gives the correct answer back if they get it wrong ❌
- Cleans up the display using string manipulation and title casing ✨

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to use `prompt-sync` to simulate `prompt()` in Node.js
- The power of `.toLowerCase()`, `.charAt()`, `.slice()`, and `.split()` for handling messy input
- How to **capitalize each word** in a sentence (👑 Title Case, baby!)
- Why user experience matters, even in terminal apps — keep it clean, cute, and user-friendly 😎

## 🧪 Sample Run

```bash
What is the Mother City? johannesburg
❌ johannesburg is incorrect. The correct answer is Cape Town.

```

## 🪄 My Mood Today

Feeling like a console queen 👑 — just me, my terminal, and some spicy string logic.
