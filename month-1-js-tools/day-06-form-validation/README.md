# 📝 Day 6: Feedback Form Project

## 🚀 Project Overview

This mini project is a clean, responsive **Feedback Form** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. It lets users submit feedback, view a confirmation screen, and reset the form to start over.

Designed as part of a full-stack learning journey, this project strengthens your understanding of:
- Form inputs and validation
- DOM manipulation
- Conditional rendering
- Event handling in JavaScript
- Styling with CSS variables and transitions

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with custom properties)
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Local assets (e.g., favicon, logo)

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

feedback-form/
├── index.html # Main HTML document
├── app.css # Styling for form and layout
├── form.js # JavaScript logic for form submission and reset
└── assets/ # Contains logo and favicon

## ✨ Features

- 👩‍💻 Fully responsive design
- 🛂 HTML5 form validation
- 🧠 Dynamic DOM manipulation (form submission hides the form and shows a success message)
- 🔁 Reset button to restart the form after submission
- ✨ Smooth transitions and custom font styles

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User fills in the form (name, last name, email, feedback)
2. On submission:
   - The form is hidden
   - A success message is shown
   - The form data is **not sent anywhere** (no backend yet)
3. Clicking the **Reset Form** button:
   - Resets all form fields
   - Restores the form to visible
   - Hides the success message
