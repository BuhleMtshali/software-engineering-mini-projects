# 📝 Day 5 - To-Do List (Mini Project)

Welcome to your Day 5 full-stack journey project — the **To-Do List App**.  
A cute but powerful little task manager built with **vanilla JavaScript**, modern CSS, and a splash of charm 💅.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This app allows users to:
- Add new tasks
- Prevent duplicates
- Delete tasks dynamically
- Interact with a clean and responsive UI

Each task is stored in an in-memory array and rendered in real-time on the screen. No database yet — we're keeping it light and local.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic and clean structure
- **CSS3** – Responsive and styled with custom fonts and variables
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – For interactivity and DOM manipulation
- **Assets** – Custom icons, favicon, and logo

---

## 🎯 Features

✅ Add tasks  
✅ Prevent duplicate tasks  
✅ Delete tasks dynamically  
✅ Re-render UI on every update  
✅ Responsive layout with modern design  
✅ Custom fonts and color variables (CSS variables used via `:root`)  
✅ Accessible and keyboard-friendly

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- `querySelector`, `addEventListener`, and event delegation
- `dataset` attributes (`data-index`) for identifying list items
- `forEach` and array management (`push`, `splice`)
- DOM creation and injection using `createElement`
- Clean, accessible UI with feedback messages
- Minimal CSS animations and responsive layout

---

## 🚀 How to Run It

1. Clone or download this project folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (no server required!).
3. Start typing your tasks and click "Add Task" to see the magic unfold.
4. Click the ❌ (trash icon) next to a task to delete it.

## ✨ Styling Notes

- Fonts imported from Google Fonts:
  - [`Winky Rough`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Winky+Rough)
  - [`Inter Tight`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter+Tight)
- Color palette managed using CSS variables:
  - `--apricot-white`, `--gold-green`, `--lavender`, `--deep-charcoal`

---

## 🧩 Ideas to Extend

- Add localStorage support to persist tasks
- Add task editing functionality
- Mark tasks as completed (with strikethrough)
- Add categories/tags and filtering
- Animate task addition/removal

## 🧠 Remember

> "If you can build a todo list from scratch and truly understand how it works, you’re halfway to frontend mastery."

Made with 💛 and good vibes.
