# 🌟 Month 1: Foundations & JavaScript Glow-Up 💻✨ (July 2025)

👋🏾 Heyyy! Welcome to **Month 1** of my Full-Stack Software Engineering adventure!  
This month is all about **getting my hands dirty** with code, making my GitHub sparkle ✨, and flexing those baby dev muscles 💪🏾 in **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

It’s me vs. logic, loops, bugs, and the DOM — and spoiler alert: **I’m winning.** 🧠💥

## 🎯 What I'm Doing This Month

🚀 Building confidence in the **CLI**, Git, and GitHub  

🧠 Mastering **JavaScript basics**: variables, loops, functions, arrays, and objects  

📟 Messing with the **DOM** like a pro  

🖱️ Handling **events**, **forms**, and **input**  

🌐 Fetching real data from APIs  

🛠️ Creating **mini-projects** to test my skills daily  

🎨 Starting to sprinkle in **CSS responsiveness**  

📂 Pushing everything to GitHub like a BOSS 😤
