## 📝 Day 5 - To-Do List Web App

A sleek, stylish, and simple To-Do List built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is part of a daily coding challenge focused on sharpening DOM skills, event handling, and responsive UI design.

“Productivity is not just checking boxes, it’s checking the right boxes. This app helps you do both.”
