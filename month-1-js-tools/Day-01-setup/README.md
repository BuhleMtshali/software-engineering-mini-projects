# 🧠 Day 1: CLI, Git, and GitHub Setup – Let the Coding Begin! 🚀

Hey hey! 👋🏽 Today marks **Day 1** of my 161-day Full-Stack Software Engineering journey, and I'm officially clocked in. 💼✨

Before diving deep into code, I set up the **tools that’ll carry me through this entire ride** — think of this as sharpening my sword before entering battle ⚔️💻.

---

## 💻 What I Did Today

✅ Installed and explored the **Command Line Interface (CLI)**  
✅ Initialized my first Git repository locally  
✅ Set up **SSH keys** and linked my terminal to GitHub (no more password prompts 👀)  
✅ Created a GitHub repo for the entire Month 1 grind  
✅ Learned basic Git commands like `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, and `git clone`  
✅ Wrote this README (obviously 😎)  
✅ Built the habit of **writing clean commit messages** like a grown-up dev 🧠🧼

## 🔧 Tools I Set Up

- 🧭 **Command Line** (Terminal on macOS)
- 🧠 **Git** – version control BFF
- 🐙 **GitHub** – where all my code will live and shine
- 🛠️ **VS Code** – my IDE of choice, with extensions installed:
  - Prettier
  - ESLint
  - GitLens
  - Live Server

---

## 🧪 Sample Git Workflow I Used

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "✨ Day 1: Set up Git & GitHub"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:BuhleMtshali/full-stack-month-1.git
git push -u origin main

```

## 🧠 What I Learned

The CLI isn’t scary — it’s actually kinda empowering 😎

Git is my version-tracking ride or die

Committing early and often = future me’s best friend

A messy desktop folder = no more. GitHub is my new portfolio 💼✨

The dotfiles life is low-key aesthetic

## 💬 Fun Quote of the Day

"Commit like nobody's watching, push like everyone is." – Unknown, but probably a dev after midnight 😅
