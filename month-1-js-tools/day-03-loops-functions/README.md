# 🔁 Day 3: Functions + Loops – FizzBuzz CLI

Welcome to **Day 3** of my full-stack developer journey!  
Today’s focus is on two of the most important building blocks in JavaScript: **functions** and **loops**.

We’re building the legendary **FizzBuzz CLI app**, a fun logic-based challenge used in real interviews.

## 📚 What I Learned Today

### ✅ JavaScript Functions
- Declaring and calling functions
- Function parameters and return values
- Reusability and modular code

### 🔄 Loops
- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- Loop control statements: `break`, `continue`

### 🧠 Problem-Solving with Logic
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- Modulo operator (`%`) for pattern checking

## 🛠 Mini Project: FizzBuzz CLI

### 📌 Project Description

Create a simple **Command Line Interface (CLI)** program that prints numbers from 1 to a user-specified number. But with a twist:

- For multiples of 3, print `"Fizz"`
- For multiples of 5, print `"Buzz"`
- For multiples of both 3 and 5, print `"FizzBuzz"`
- Otherwise, print the number itself

### 🚀 Features

- User input for the maximum number
- Input validation
- Clean console output using loops
- Modular logic wrapped inside a function

## 💻 How to Run It

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

```bash
# Open terminal
cd path/to/day-03-functions-loops/
node fizzbuzz.js

You’ll be prompted to enter a number. The program will then output the FizzBuzz logic up to that number.
