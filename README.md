# 🚀 Full-Stack Dev Journey: 6-Month Roadmap Projects

Welcome to my **Full-Stack JavaScript Developer Journey** 🚧  
This repo is my personal logbook of all the daily mini projects, built from scratch over a focused 6-month curriculum (July 1 – December 30).

## 🧠 What's Inside

Each folder in this repo represents a **daily project** or **weekly capstone**—spanning everything from JavaScript fundamentals to AI integration using Python.

Topics covered include:
- ✅ JavaScript (Vanilla, ES6+)
- ⚛️ React & TypeScript
- 🔧 Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Prisma
- 🌐 Next.js, Firebase, PostgreSQL
- 🧪 Testing (Jest, Playwright, CI/CD)
- 🐍 Python + Flask APIs
- 🤖 OpenAI API, LLMs, AI Engineering
- 📦 DevOps (GitHub Actions, Docker, Deployment)
- 💼 Career Prep & Final Projects

## 📁 Folder Structure
/month-1-js-tools/
day-01-dev-setup/
day-02-js-basics/
...
/month-2-react-ts/
/month-3-node-auth/
/month-4-next-db-testing/
/month-5-python-ai/
/month-6-capstones/

Each project folder includes:
- `README.md` with project brief
- Source code (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.py`, etc.)
- Assets (if needed)
- Screenshots or links to deployed projects (optional)

## 🛠️ Tools & Stack

- Code: `VSCode`, `Node.js`, `pnpm/yarn`, `Git`
- Deployment: `GitHub Pages`, `Vercel`, `Firebase Hosting`
- DevOps: `Docker`, `CI/CD with GitHub Actions`
- APIs: `REST`, `OpenAI`, `Firebase`, `MongoDB Atlas`, `Prisma`

## 🏁 Goals

By the end of December 2025, I aim to:
- 💻 Be a confident **full-stack software engineer**
- 👩🏾‍💻 Build and deploy **production-ready apps**
- 🧠 Understand and apply **AI engineering principles**
- 📁 Have a **portfolio of 100+ projects**
- 💼 Be job-ready for global tech roles

## 📌 Status

This repo is actively growing. Check back for updates daily.  
Each push is a step closer to full-stack mastery.
